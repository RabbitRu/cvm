RAI Dataset for Scene Detection
===============================

This dataset features ten broadcast videos from the Rai Scuola video
archive (http://www.scuola.rai.it/), mainly documentaries and talk shows.

Given a video the "videos" directory, the file "scenes_<number>.txt" contains information about the ground-truth scenes.
For each scene the file stores a new line with two numbers, that represent the starting and ending frames of the scene.
